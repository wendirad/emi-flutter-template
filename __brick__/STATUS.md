# Status

Project state. Do not read or edit this file whole: use `bash tool/status.sh` (see `AGENTS.md`).

## Format

One line per item, so a single `grep` finds it.

- Feature row: `| F-<name> | <Feature> | <state> | <notes> |` in the table below. States: `done`, `partial`, `placeholder`, `untested`, `todo`.
- Task: `- [<mark>] T<nnn> <area>: <title>`. Marks: `[ ]` todo, `[~]` in progress, `[x]` done, `[!]` blocked (reason in the title).
- Subtask: indented under its task as `  - [<mark>] T<nnn>.<n> <title>`.
- `<area>` is the feature or layer: `auth`, `profile`, `settings`, `core`, `l10n`, `theme`, `app`.
- Finished top-level tasks move to `docs/status/archive.md` with `bash tool/status.sh archive`.
